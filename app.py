                    Please provide a general, reassuring, and easy-to-understand explanation. Use Markdown for emphasis on key advice and the final disclaimer.
                    1. Briefly acknowledge the user's reported symptoms.
                    2. Reassure the user. Explain that the 'potential considerations' from the model are based on symptom patterns and are **not diagnoses**.
                    3. If specific conditions were listed by the model (in `top_cond_llm_parts`), briefly and gently mention them as possibilities to discuss with a doctor if symptoms align or cause concern. Do not overstate their certainty. If none were strongly indicated, acknowledge that and emphasize general well-being.
                    4. **If applicable, based on the types of conditions mentioned (e.g., if the model suggested 'Acne' or 'Psoriasis', you might suggest a dermatologist; if 'Arthritis', a rheumatologist; if 'Bronchial Asthma', a pulmonologist or primary care physician), suggest the type of medical specialist a person *might* consult. Frame these as general suggestions, for example: "For persistent skin concerns like those sometimes associated with [Condition X], a dermatologist is often the specialist to see." or "If joint pain similar to what's seen in [Condition Y] is a primary concern, consulting a rheumatologist could be helpful." Always add that a primary care doctor is a good first point of contact. If no specific conditions are highlighted, or if they are very general, you can skip specific specialist suggestions or just advise seeing a primary care physician for guidance.**
                    5. Provide general, safe advice for managing mild symptoms (e.g., monitor symptoms, rest, stay hydrated).
                    6. **Offer brief, actionable advice on preparing for a doctor's visit, for example: "When you see a doctor, it can be helpful to: \n    - Write down all your symptoms and when they started. \n    - List any medications or supplements you're taking. \n    - Note any questions you have for the doctor."**
                    7. **Strongly emphasize the importance of consulting a doctor for an accurate diagnosis and treatment plan**, especially if symptoms are severe, worsening, persistent, or if the user is worried.
                    8. Conclude with a clear and prominent disclaimer, using Markdown for emphasis: "**Important Reminder: I am an AI assistant designed for informational purposes only and cannot provide medical advice or a diagnosis. The information shared should not replace consultation with a qualified healthcare professional. Always seek the advice of your physician or other qualified health provider with any questions you may have regarding a medical condition.**"
                    
                    Keep your tone calm, supportive, and easy to read. Avoid medical jargon where possible or explain it simply. Make sure key takeaways, like specialist suggestions (if any) and the advice for seeing a doctor, are clearly presented, perhaps using bold text or bullet points for readability as appropriate.
